# youtime
https://krkode.github.io/youtime/
website for filtering youtube search results by year of upload cause there's some evil demon at yt hq who doesn't think ppl wanna watch videos from 2012.
i was thinking it might be cause its cold data so maybe its a bigger strain on their resources to load? or maybe they don't index the date of upload so querying on date is too exhaustive?
or maybe it goes against some new policy but i dont get how it would benefit them more if ppl are watching recent videos rather than old ones? isn't it inefficient to host all this old content without getting use (aka ad revenue) out it cause ppl cant easily access it? maybe they're gonna start deleting stuff?

# usage
sorry but if you wanna use this site, you have to generate your own api key from 
https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application?authuser=2

i wish it didn't have to be like this BUT im reading everywhere that publishing an api key, EVEN if its just for public data, is a big no no. also there's a limit on the amount of requests i can send through with my key and i dont need you trying to max it out thanks! get your own

add duration to preview
css if you care
new tab in chrome
more than 25 results
add views to preview
query in views if possible cause search api is sometimes returning stuff that doesn't seem entirely related to keyword search
